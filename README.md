## üìä **Code Overview**

### **Data Preparation**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df_osd = pd.read_csv('online_sales_dataset.csv')
df_osd['InvoiceDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df_osd['InvoiceDate'])
df_osd['Year'] = df_osd['InvoiceDate'].dt.year
```

### **Sales Trend Analysis**
```python
for year, data in data_by_year.items():
    monthly_sales = data.resample('M', on='InvoiceDate')['TotalSales'].sum()
